// Why: every other WebView test exercises one slice of the document, so an edit to an
// uncovered region ships silently. A diff here means the emitted WebView source changed —
// update these values only when that change is deliberate, and only after checking the
// document still runs. Refactors that merely move slice boundaries must leave them alone.
// Last deliberate change: the buffer ends bend and spring back instead of
// refusing to move (UIScrollView's f(x,d,c) = x*d*c/(d+c*x), c = 0.55). The
// bend is visual only — no row is committed and the spring returns the offset
// to exactly 0, so the at-rest row-boundary invariant is unchanged.
