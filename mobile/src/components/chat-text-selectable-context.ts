/**
 * Whether chat text should accept a press-and-hold right now.

 * Android starts text selection on a long-press over any `selectable` Text
 * and plays its own haptic when it does. While the list is moving, a finger
 * put down to stop a fling and held for the long-press timeout arms that
 * detector: a buzz out of nowhere and a stray selection (reported
 * 2026-09-12). The chat view flips this off while a scroll is in flight and
 * back on when it settles; outside a scroll — the case where the person means
 * to select — nothing changes.
