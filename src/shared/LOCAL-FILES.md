# Code UI's own files inside src/shared

`src/shared/` is vendored Orca code: re-vendor it, never edit it here. These files
are the exceptions — Code UI authored them and they have no upstream counterpart at
any commit. A re-vendor must not delete them and must not be surprised by them.

- `native-chat-pasted-image-paths.ts` — imported by `native-chat-image-transcript-markers.ts`
  and by three files under `mobile/src/session/`. It belongs in `mobile/src/session/`;
  moving it also edits the vendored importer, so that is its own commit, not a
  side effect of a port.

Everything else under `src/shared/` came from upstream. When a file is re-vendored
past the base commit in `UPSTREAM.txt`, record its own commit there.

## Vendored files carrying a local hunk

These came from upstream and were then edited here. A re-vendor must
re-apply the hunk, not drop it. Both fix behaviour upstream does not have.

- `native-chat-session-option-snapshot.ts` — an unlisted tracked model (a
  release newer than the catalog) keeps the catalog's fallback effort rows,
  so the sheet is not model-name-only.
- `native-chat-session-option-state.ts` — when the agent reports a different
  model than the one the user picked, the user's own non-reported picks are
  carried onto the reported model instead of being dropped.
